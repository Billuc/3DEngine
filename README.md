# 3DEngine

I tried creating a kind of a 3D engine on my own for a long time as a kind of a challenge.
I recently (end of october 2020) went back to this challenge, this time using Python instead of Java.
I successfully developped a simple engine that can plot points on a canvas !

Next steps are : 
 - Drawing figures (polygones at first)
 - Trying to handle intersections
 - Optimisations
